            <h3>09/2017 - 05/2021, Latvia</h3>
            <p>At Daugavpils University, students pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Physics engage in a comprehensive curriculum designed to provide a strong foundation in various areas of physics and its applications. The program typically spans six semesters and is taught in English, making it accessible to international students.</p>
            <p>Key areas of study include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                Core Physics Principles: Students learn fundamental concepts in classical mechanics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and modern physics. This foundational knowledge prepares them for more advanced topics and applications.
                </li>
                <li>
                Mathematical and Computational Skills: The curriculum emphasizes the mathematical tools necessary for theoretical and experimental physics, including calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations. Computational methods are also integrated, enabling students to model physical systems effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                Laboratory Work: Practical experience is a crucial component of the program, with students engaging in laboratory exercises that reinforce theoretical knowledge through hands-on experiments and data analysis.
                </li>
                <li>
                Interdisciplinary Approaches: Students may also explore topics that intersect with other fields such as materials science, environmental physics, and optics, broadening their understanding of how physics applies in various contexts. 
                </li>
                <li>
                Research Opportunities: While formal internships may not be required, students often have the chance to participate in research projects, which can enhance their learning experience and provide insights into real-world applications of physics. 
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The program aims to develop critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and a solid understanding of the scientific method, preparing graduates for careers in research, education, engineering, or further academic study in physics or related fields
